    <p>We believe in enforcing a strict policy of self-identification, knowing that the legal drinking age in Italy is sixteen we have decided to only sell to customers who are eighteen and over. We will not be liable for any infractions of the law associated with drinking a beverage sold by Zugy, what our customers do with our product after they have received it is their own responsibility. Our liability ends when the customer has received and paid for the product we sell to them, to be clear, we are not responsible for; under aged drinking, drinking related accidents or illnesses (alcohol poisoning, unconsciousness etc.), any drinking related deaths or serious injuries. Our customers are responsible for their own actions.</p>
    <p>Our customers are mature and fully understand the risks associated with consuming alcoholic beverages, we continue to encourage our customers to be safe and responsible while drinking, being aware of who they are with and their environment in general. We under no circumstances endorse drinking and driving at all and take a very hard stance against any impaired driving or any irresponsible operation of machinery while inebriated. Agreeing to become a member of Zugy also means agreeing to the terms and conditions and the privacy policy outlined above. Anyone who has created an account had to agree to our policies prior to the accounts creation meaning that it is impossible for someone to buy our products without having agreed to the terms and conditions of their uses and the privacy policy to do with the collection of their data</p>
