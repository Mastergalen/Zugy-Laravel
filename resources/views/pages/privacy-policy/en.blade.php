    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your

    <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
        transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your
        web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>
    <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information
        offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
        service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store
        personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
